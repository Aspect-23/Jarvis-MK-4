Dear [Principal's Name],  

I hope this message finds you well.  

I am writing to inform you that my son, Mohammad Suheil Raza, a student of Class [X], Section [A], Admission No. [XXXXX], is unwell and under medical treatment. His doctor has advised him to take complete rest for a few days to recover fully.  

In light of this, I kindly request you to grant him sick leave from [start date] to [end date]. He will make sure to catch up on any pending classwork or assignments upon his return.  

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your understanding in this matter.  

Thank you for considering our request.  

Yours sincerely,
